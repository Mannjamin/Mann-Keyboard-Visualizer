A basic Keyboard Key-Press Visualizer in C#

## Purpose:
This basic keyboard listener / Visualizer was originally developed out of curiousity to see what my keyboard looked like as I performed tests on https://10fastfingers.com - a popular website for users to test how fast they can type common words.

Currently, this application merely lights up a virtual keyboard on keypress. 
Future editions will utilise a Hook Listener so the application can function without the need for application focus. 

**This Project is also one of my first developments in C#.**

**C#as a Object Oriented Programming language is very similar to Java and has a much more intuitive Graphical User Interface IDE within Microsoft Visual Studio.**

## Future Developments

In the future, I intend to implement a Keyboard Hook Handler / Listener to allow this application to light up buttons even when the application is not in focus. This will allow users to visually display what is happenning to the keyboard as they perform a task such as TypeRacing, Programming or Typing in general.
